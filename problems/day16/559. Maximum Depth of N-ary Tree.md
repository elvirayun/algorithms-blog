# 559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree

## Problem

*****

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

*Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).*

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./559.%20Maximum%20Depth%20of%20N-ary%20Tree.assets/narytreeexample.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

![img](./559.%20Maximum%20Depth%20of%20N-ary%20Tree.assets/sample_4_964.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: 5
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The total number of nodes is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.
